# Comparision-of-SVM-and-KNN
This code compares the performance of SVM and KNN while each of them classify the images of hand-written digits.
Recognition of hand-written digits by reading the data from MNIST dataset.
Here, the concern is on the implementation of SVM and KNN, and their performance. 
The code for data pre-processing has been ommitted here.
Put briefly, the data contains the pixel values of hand-written digit images of 28X28 pixels in each image.
The pixel values were then read and arranged as a column of 784(28*28) features, and then it was classified.
